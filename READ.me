This script will test out an alternative method to get ms-caspt2 results more efficiently,
using the provided scripts from Luca De Vico, shown during QCES-2025 in Cluj-Napoca.

Required part from output looks like: 
Hamiltonian Effective Couplings
 -------------------------------

                 |    2 >
 <    1 |  -3.21225208893881E-06
 <    2 |  -3.07574215974517E+02
 <    3 |  -1.16430210323939E-06

The results are identical untill 10^-7 Hartree!
Let's check what happens if we do SO-CASSI
